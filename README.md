The Interac(ve Adventure Game is a simple interac/ve game where players can navigate through different rooms, collect items, and interact with their environment through text commands. It is a terminal-based game that focuses on crea/ng a seamless player experience with minimal input, mimicking the old- school adventure games where imagina/on drives the gameplay.
In this project, the player starts in a room and can explore adjacent rooms using direc/onal commands like “move north” or “move east.” Each room contains a descrip/on of the environment and may also include items that the player can pick up and add to their inventory. The player's goal is to explore the environment, gather objects, and experience the Interac/ve world.# Interactive-Adventure-Game-in-Rust
